  <blockquote cite="https://www.businessinsider.com/nelson-mandelas-deepest-fear-misquotation-2013-10">Our deepest fear is not that we are weak. Our deepest fear is that we are
    powerful beyond measure. It is our light, not our darkness that most frightens us. We ask ourselves, who am I to be brilliant, gorgeous, talented, fabulous? Actually, who are you not to be?
    You are a child of God. Your playing small does not
    serve the world ... As we are liberated from our own fear, our presence automatically liberates others.
